# EEG Seizure Prediction Project

## Overview

This project explores machine learning models to predict seizures using EEG data, aiming to improve early intervention. It includes four Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific model, and a detailed report summarizing methodologies and results.

## Notebooks

1. **Explore_TabNet.ipynb**  
   Implements TabNet, a deep learning model for tabular data, focusing on interpretability and performance.

2. **Explore_XGBoost.ipynb**  
   Utilizes XGBoost for robust, efficient training and evaluation on imbalanced data.

3. **Explore_1DCNN.ipynb**  
   Applies 1D-CNN to capture temporal patterns in EEG signals.

4. **Explore_Random_Forest.ipynb**  
   Uses Random Forest as a baseline with feature importance analysis.

## Report

The accompanying report details dataset preprocessing, model workflows, performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC), and a comparative analysis of the models.

## Key Takeaways

- Deep learning models (TabNet, 1D-CNN) excel at pattern recognition, while ensemble methods (XGBoost, Random Forest) provide robust baselines. 1D-CNN significantly outperformed TabNet.
- Results highlight the potential of machine learning in seizure prediction and areas for improvement.

## Usage

Run the notebooks in Jupyter with the necessary dependencies. Refer to the report for a deeper understanding of the findings.
