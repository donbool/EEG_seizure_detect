EEG Seizure Prediction Project
Overview
This project explores machine learning models to predict seizures using EEG data, aiming to improve early intervention. It includes four Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific model, and a detailed report summarizing methodologies and results.

Notebooks
Explore_TabNet.ipynb: Implements TabNet, a deep learning model for tabular data, focusing on interpretability and performance.
Explore_XGBoost.ipynb: Utilizes XGBoost for robust, efficient training and evaluation on imbalanced data.
Explore_1DCNN.ipynb: Applies 1D-CNN to capture temporal patterns in EEG signals.
Explore_Random_Forest.ipynb: Uses Random Forest as a baseline with feature importance analysis.
Report
The accompanying report details dataset preprocessing, model workflows, performance metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC), and a comparative analysis of the models.

Key Takeaways
Deep learning models (TabNet, 1D-CNN) excel at pattern recognition, while ensemble methods (XGBoost, Random Forest) provide robust baselines.
Results highlight the potential of machine learning in seizure prediction and areas for improvement.
Usage
Run the notebooks in Jupyter with the necessary dependencies. Refer to the report for a deeper understanding of the findings.
